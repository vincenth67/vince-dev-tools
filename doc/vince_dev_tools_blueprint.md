# vince-dev-tools Development Blueprint

## 1. Executive Summary

vince-dev-tools is a personal developer productivity toolkit designed to standardize and streamline common development workflows for Chrome extension projects. The toolkit provides a command-line interface called `vit` that abstracts away common Git operations, enforces conventional commits, and automates version management across multiple files.

### 1.1 Core Objectives

- **Standardization**: Enforce consistent Git Flow branching model and conventional commit practices
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive Git operations and version management
- **Productivity**: Reduce setup time and minimize errors across projects
- **Modularity**: Provide extensible foundation for future developer utilities

### 1.2 Key Features

- Smart Git repository initialization with proper branching setup
- Automated branch management following Git Flow principles
- Conventional commit enforcement with smart prefixing
- Synchronized version management for package.json and manifest.json
- Transparent Git operation execution with verbose output
- Interactive conflict resolution for merge operations

### 1.3 Target Audience

Solo developer (Vincent) working on Chrome extension projects, requiring consistent development practices across multiple repositories.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack

- **Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Distribution**: NPM package from private GitHub repository
- **Installation**: Project-specific via `npm install`
- **Execution**: Command-line interface through `npx` or global installation

### 2.3 Development Environment Setup

#### 2.3.1 Folder Organization

Two separate directories are required for development:

```
/development-workspace/
├── vince-dev-tools/           # Tool development repository
│   ├── .git/                  # Tool's Git repository
│   ├── lib/vit/               # Tool implementation
│   └── [project files]
└── vince-dev-tools_testing/      # Testing environment
    ├── .git/                  # Separate Git repository for testing
    ├── package.json           # Test project configuration
    ├── manifest.json          # Test Chrome extension manifest
    └── node_modules/
        └── vince-dev-tools/   # Tool installed here for testing
```

IMPORTANT: 
You AI will be just developing what is in "vince-dev-tools/", that is your task and project.  
"vince-dev-tools_testing/" is a separate project developed externally, used to test the correctness of all the vit command you will create.
   
  #### 2.3.2 Development Workflow

2. **Tool Testing**: Install tool in `vince-dev-tools_testing/` using `npm install ../vince-dev-tools`
3. **Command Testing**: Execute `vit` commands in `vince-dev-tools_testing/`
4. **Iteration**: Update tool code, reinstall, and retest

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 Code Organization

#### 4.1.1 File Responsibilities
- **bin/vit.js**: Command-line entry point and argument parsing
- **lib/index.js**: Main command routing and exports
- **lib/vit/[command].js**: Individual command implementations
- **lib/vit/git.js**: Git command execution and error handling
- **lib/vit/files.js**: File system operations for JSON files
- **lib/vit/validation.js**: Input validation and branch name checking
- **lib/vit/output.js**: Colored console output and formatting

#### 4.1.2 Coding Standards
- **Comments**: Comprehensive commenting for all functions and complex logic
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with descriptive messages
- **Verbose Output**: Show all Git commands being executed
- **Consistency**: Consistent output formatting across all commands
- **Modularity**: Reusable utility functions for common operations

### 4.2 Testing Strategy

#### 4.2.1 No Unit Testing
Based on project requirements, unit testing is excluded to focus on rapid development and deployment.  
The testing of all the command will be done in a external project called "vince-dev-tools_testing/", which you are not in charge of.

#### 4.2.2 Manual Testing Approach
- **Development Environment**: Use separate vince-dev-tools_testing for testing
- **Real Scenarios**: Test with actual Chrome extension project structure
- **Edge Cases**: Manually test error conditions and edge cases
- **Integration Testing**: Test complete workflows from init to release

#### 4.2.3 Test Files
Create dummy test files in vince-dev-tools_testing:
```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "test-extension",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "Test Chrome extension"
}

// manifest.json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "just a test",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "Just a dummy test app."
}
```

### 4.3 Git Workflow Strategy

#### 4.3.1 Branching Model
The tool implements and enforces a streamlined Git Flow model:

- **main**: Production-ready, stable releases only
- **develop**: Integration branch for completed features
- **feat/feature-name**: Feature development branches
- **fix/fix-name**: Bug fix branches

#### 4.3.2 Merge Strategies
- **feat/fix → develop**: Normal merge (preserve commit history)
- **develop → main**: Squash merge (clean release history)

#### 4.3.3 Conventional Commits
Enforce Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification:
- **Format**: `type(scope): description`
- **Supported Types**: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, style
- **Auto-prefixing**: Based on branch name or explicit flags

### 4.4 Version Management

#### 4.4.1 Semantic Versioning
Follow semantic versioning (X.Y.Z) with specific interpretation:
- **X (Major)**: 0 = pre-1.0 release, 1+ = major releases
- **Y (Minor)**: Significant features, major modules, milestones
- **Z (Patch)**: Bug fixes, small improvements, optimizations

#### 4.4.2 Dual File Management
Maintain version synchronization between:
- **package.json**: NPM ecosystem version
- **manifest.json**: Chrome extension version

## 5. Installation and Usage

### 5.1 Package Configuration

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "vince-dev-tools": "git+https://github.com/username/vince-dev-tools.git"
  }
}
```

#### 5.2.2 Usage
```bash

npx vit init
npx vit newbranch feat/new-feature
npx vit commit add new functionality

# Or install globally

vit init
```

## 6. Future Considerations(out of scope)

### 6.1 Extensibility

The modular architecture supports future additions:
- Additional command implementations in `lib/vit/`
- Additional commands other than vit in `lib/new-command/`
- Extended validation rules
- Additional file format support
- Integration with other development tools

### 6.2 Potential Enhancements

- Configuration file support for customizable behavior
- Additional conventional commit types
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Support for other project types beyond Chrome extensions

## 7. Complete Workflow Example

### 7.1 Project Setup to First Release

```bash
# 0. Verify Node.js is installed (one-time check)
node --version
npm --version
# If these commands fail, install Node.js from https://nodejs.org first

# 1. Create project directory and basic files
mkdir my-chrome-extension
cd my-chrome-extension
# (create manifest.json, package.json, source files manually)

# 2. Initialize npm project (if package.json doesn't exist)
npm init -y

# 3. Install dev tools
npm install git+https://github.com/username/vince-dev-tools.git --save-dev

# 4. Initialize Git with vit
vit init
# → Sets up Git, creates branches, prompts for remote

# 5. Develop first feature
vit newbranch feat/popup-interface
# (work on feature, edit files)
git add src/popup.html src/popup.js
vit commit create basic popup interface
git add src/styles.css
vit commit add styling to popup
git add src/popup.js
vit commit fix button click handler

# 6. Integrate and release
vit merge-dev              # Merge to develop (preserve history)
vit version minor          # Bump to 0.1.0
vit merge-main            # Create release (squash to main, create tag)

# 7. Continue development
git checkout develop
vit newbranch feat/next-feature
```


 # 8. New Fetures and improvement

  This section is where I will write specifications for features and improvements that I didn't prepare or t about initially.

## 8.1 vit init, adding -o flag  
The vit init command requires an enhancement to support automated testing and scripting scenarios. Add an optional -o flag that accepts a GitHub repository URL as a parameter. When this flag is provided, the command should skip the interactive prompts for remote origin setup and automatically configure the specified repository as the remote origin. The behavior should be: vit init -o https://github.com/username/repo.git will initialize the Git repository, create the main/develop branches, set versions to 0.0.0, make the initial commit, and automatically add the provided URL as the remote origin without any user prompts. If the -o flag is not provided, maintain the existing interactive behavior with prompts for remote setup. This flag enables automated testing and CI/CD integration while preserving the current user experience for manual usage.
  
## 8.2 vit merge-main, adding -f flagz
The vit merge-main command requires an enhancement to handle merge conflicts automatically in testing and automation scenarios. Add an optional -f (force) flag that bypasses the interactive conflict resolution prompt. When this flag is provided and merge conflicts occur during the squash merge operation, the command should automatically resolve conflicts by favoring develop's version (equivalent to answering 'y' to the current prompt). The behavior should be: vit merge-main -f will perform the merge and automatically force-resolve any conflicts using --strategy=recursive -X theirs without prompting the user. If the -f flag is not provided, maintain the existing interactive behavior with the conflict resolution prompt. This flag enables automated release processes and testing while preserving the current safety-first approach for manual usage where users can review conflicts before resolution.















This blueprint provides comprehensive guidance for implementing the vince-dev-tools productivity toolkit, ensuring consistent development practices and efficient workflow automation.  
  
  IMPORTANT: As an AI, this project, vince-dev-tools will be backed up on github.com. You are not allowed to run git command yourself when building the project, unless explicitly instructed otherwise. The developer (me - Vincent) allways does that myself.
